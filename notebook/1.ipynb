    "Another dimension is batch learning vs. online learning, i.e. whether the system updates and learns over time. However, this distincion is more between how the solution is launched and monitored, rather than an algorthimic difference, since looking at the learning over time, up to point T, you could very well feed it all the data it has ut to time T as a batch, and you would have the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last dimension that we could classify through is \"instance based\" vs. model based. This is related to the concept of parametric and non-parametric methods in statistics."
